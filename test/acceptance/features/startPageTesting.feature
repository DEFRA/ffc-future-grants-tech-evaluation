Feature: Test start page

    #Scenario: Open start page

    #    Given I open the url "/slurry-infrastructure/start"
    #    Then I expect that element "h1" contains the text "Check if you can apply for a Slurry Infrastructure Grant"
    #    When I click on the link "Start now"
    #    Then I expect that the url contains "/slurry-infrastructure/applicant-type"
